Hi all,
  cvswebedit is now under the management of SourceForge!

Furthermore, the authors of cvsweb have agreed to combine effort with that of cvswebedit, so we are in the process of merging the two work streams.

The new system, CVS Web Client, can be found at http://cvswebclient.sourceforge.net/

Regards,
  Martin.
